# Picks and Shovels

Objective:
Identify the pick and shovel projects in each of 10 defined categories of Web3 cryptocurrency tokens (and coins).  

Defined: 
- Pick and shovel plays are investment strategies that own underlying technology (assets) needed to produce a good or service instead of a final output
- Borrowing this definition, the s are not the tokens themselves, but the applications/use-cases 
- Instrumental components of a sustainable and efficient Web3 infrastructure


Categories:

Disclaimer - There is some cross-over between some categories, and tokens may fall under multiple categories.  For the sake of analysis, we defined the categories ahead of time.


- Smart Contract Platforms
- Metaverse Token
- Multi-Chain Solutions
- Decentralized Storage + Data Retrieval
- Decentralized Finance Platform
- Internet of Things (IoT)
